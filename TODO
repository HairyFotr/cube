Connected Worlds

basic idea:
 - two worlds, black and white
 - connected because they are showing the same objects
 - switching between them is part of the gameplay (somehow)

gameplay:
 - infinite scroller (switching between black and white to get over obstacles)

transition between the worlds:
 - how to explain that the worlds are connected?!

(I need to figure out what I'm actually going to do)

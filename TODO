Connected Worlds

TODO:
1. More Levels
2. Level Transitions (with triggers)
3. Triggers (for level changes, movable blocks, color changes etc.)
4. Score (1 point for each obstacle, 2 points for close calls)
5. Speed should increase with levels
6. Movable obstacles
7. Basic UI, explain controls (space bar transitions you between worlds - it is because of you, noble red block, that the worlds are connected. You are the only thing connecting them. If you fail everything will be lost. True story.


basic idea:
 - two worlds, black and white
 - connected because they are showing the same objects
 - switching between them is part of the gameplay (somehow)

gameplay:
 - infinite scroller (switching between black and white to get over obstacles)

transition between the worlds:
 - how to explain that the worlds are connected?!

(I need to figure out what I'm actually going to do)
